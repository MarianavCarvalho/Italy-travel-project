                <p>
                The Colosseum is an elliptical amphitheatre in the centre of the city of Rome, Italy, just east of the Roman Forum. It is the <strong>largest ancient amphitheatre ever built.</strong>

                <p>The Colosseum is built of travertine limestone, tuff (volcanic rock), and brick-faced concrete. It could hold an estimated <strong>50,000 to 80,000 spectators</strong> at various points in its history. It was used for gladiatorial contests and public spectacles including animal hunts, executions and dramas based on Roman mythology. The building ceased to be used for entertainment in the early medieval era.</p>
